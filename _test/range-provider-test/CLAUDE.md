# Board — authoring guide

This folder is a **Persephone Board**: a small web app whose UI you own as a
plain HTML page, backed by scripts you write in any language. Persephone hosts the
page in a locked-down, cross-origin `<iframe>` and injects a single bridge object,
`window.persephone`.

The board bridge is version **1.13.0** in this build. Check `persephone.version` before using a
bridge member that may not exist in an older app. Bridge `1.13.0` adds
`persephone.settings.get(id)` and `persephone.settings.onChange(cb)`, which read the settings your
board declares in its manifest; `1.12.0` added `persephone.clipboard.writeImage(data)` and
`persephone.clipboard.writeText(text)` for native OS clipboard writes; the preceding `1.11.0`
release added transient page-toolbar text. These additions are backward-compatible with existing
boards.

**Board settings need a stable identity.** Persephone honours a manifest's `settings` block only
when the manifest carries **both** `author` and `name` — they form the `author/name` key the values
are stored under, which is what lets them survive the board folder moving. Without both, the block
is dropped with a registration issue and `persephone.settings.get()` rejects with an error naming
the missing field. Changing `author` or `name` later moves the key and orphans anything already
stored under the old one, including board variables.

## Host-rendered board toolbar

Trusted and bundled boards may call `persephone.toolbar.set(controls)` with the complete ordered
catalog and `persephone.toolbar.update(partial)` to patch existing ids. The catalog is capped at
eight rendered controls; malformed, duplicate, unknown-update, and over-cap entries are ignored
with a warning in `ui.log`. The fixed types are `button`, `toggle`, `menu`, `select`, and `input`.
Values are host-owned and uncontrolled.

```js
persephone.toolbar.set([
  { id: "refresh", type: "button", title: "Refresh", icon: { name: "refresh" } },
  { id: "enabled", type: "toggle", label: "Enabled", value: true },
  { id: "mode", type: "select", options: [{ value: "all", label: "All" }], value: "all" },
  { id: "query", type: "input", placeholder: "Filter", value: "" },
]);
const off = persephone.toolbar.onAction(({ id, type, value }) => {
  // button has no value; toggle is boolean; menu/select/input are strings
});
```

Inputs send one string event after 500 ms of quiet time; menus send their item id, selects their
option value, and toggles their new boolean. Every live control is addressed by
`data-name="board-toolbar-control-${id}"` in `BoardEditor.elements`, while host/window automation
is the correct way to operate it (the board iframe methods target iframe content).

Icons accept exactly `{ name }`, `{ svg, preserveColors? }`, or board-root-relative
`{ file, preserveColors? }`. Names use the registered icon set. Relative files reject absolute,
`..`, and escaping paths. SVG is size-capped, parsed with `DOMParser`, rebuilt against an explicit
allowlist, and rejects scripts, styles, foreign objects, images, uses, event attributes, and
external links; normal SVG fill/stroke is forced to `currentColor`. `preserveColors: true` and
raster files render through `<img>`. This is rendering hygiene for trusted content and does not
replace the existing trust gate.

The catalog is transient main-frame state: reload, navigation, disposal, or loss of trust clears
the controls and their dynamic element declarations, and a new frame must call `set()` again.

## Board page-toolbar text

The main view may call `persephone.toolbar.setText(text)` to replace the wide middle toolbar label
temporarily. The slot is blank until the board supplies text; `persephone.toolbar.setText("")` clears
it rather than restoring the board root path. While board text is shown, the label's native tooltip
carries that full path. The value is not persisted and
is cleared when the frame reloads, errors, is disposed, loses trust, or is navigated away from, so
the replacement frame must set it again.

## Board identity: `board-manifest.json`

This folder is recognized as a board because it contains **`board-manifest.json`** —
that file's presence is what makes Persephone treat the folder as a board. It holds the
schema version plus optional **descriptive metadata** and, optionally, the **Custom Editor**
fields that let the board act as a file editor:

The non-empty trimmed pair `author` + `name` is also the board's stable identity for portable
board-variable namespaces. This generic template keeps those fields empty; Persephone's board
scaffold fills `name` from the requested board name and `author` from `boards.default-author`
(or `""` when unset). A missing or empty author therefore leaves the board on its root-path
fallback and is a valid creation state. If either identity field changes after variables exist,
the namespace changes and the old values are orphaned. Persephone performs no automatic
migration, copying, merging, or pruning; any deliberate migration is the user's responsibility.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "name": "My Board",
  "description": "What this board does.",
  "author": "you",
  "repository": "https://github.com/you/your-board",
  "minBridgeVersion": "1.11.0",
  "permissions": ["service", "contentProviders"],
  "service": "scripts/service.mjs",
  "contentProviders": [
    { "type": "acme/mem", "schemes": ["mem"] }
  ],

  "fileMasks": ["*.drawio"],
  "editorPriority": 100,
  "editorName": "DrawIO"
}
```

- `name` (optional) — display name; defaults to the **folder name** when omitted or empty. The
  generic template's empty value is filled by Persephone's scaffold.
- `description` / `author` / `repository` (optional) — metadata for humans/agents. `author` and
  `name` together are the stable identity described above.
- `minBridgeVersion` (optional) — the bridge version required by the board. A board above the
  shipped bridge is listed as incompatible and does not register its editors.
- `permissions` (optional) — an ordered list of requested surfaces shown during trust and in Board
  Info. This is **disclosure and lifecycle hygiene, not a security boundary**: trust already lets
  a board run arbitrary renderer and Node code, so `"service"` is not a privilege grant or sandbox.
- `service` (optional) — a board-relative ESM entry for a platform-owned module service. A board
  with only this field is still a valid service board even when it has no editor association.

### Capability handlers

A board that can answer named requests declares handlers in the `capabilities` array. The array is
the functional registration axis; add `"capabilities"` to `permissions` to disclose the surface in
trust and Board Info. As with the other board permissions, this is disclosure and lifecycle
hygiene, not a security boundary or a grant.

```json
{
  "minBridgeVersion": "1.11.0",
  "permissions": ["capabilities"],
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "acme.convert",
      "version": 1,
      "priority": 60,
      "title": "Convert a document",
      "accepts": ["text/markdown"],
      "payloadSchema": { "type": "object" },
      "headless": false
    }
  ]
}
```

`id` is non-empty, contains no whitespace or `@`, and should use a vendor prefix for board-owned
names. `version` is an integer major version (default 1); `priority` is numeric (default 50), with
platform handlers winning exact ties. Multiple trusted boards may declare the same id and compete
by priority; losing registrations remain visible through discovery. `accepts` is an optional MIME
filter, `payloadSchema` is descriptive (the handler validates its own payload), and `title` is
display metadata. `headless` is preserved for discovery, but a winning headless declaration is
outside the page-backed intent channel and settles as `no-handler`. A capability is resolved in
the caller's window: an already-open winning handler page is reused, otherwise Persephone opens
that board there.

### In-memory intents: `persephone.intent.*`

The winning board receives a request as a structured value:

```js
function handleRequest(request) {
    if (handled.has(request.requestId)) return;
    handled.add(request.requestId);
    const { name } = request.payload;
    request.resolve({ greeting: `Hello, ${name}`, requestId: request.requestId });
}

const handled = new Set();
persephone.intent.onRequest(handleRequest);
const initial = persephone.intent.get();
if (initial) handleRequest(initial); // page opened for this request
```

`persephone.intent.get()` returns the current request, if this page was opened or reused for one;
`persephone.intent.onRequest(callback)` registers a callback and returns an unsubscribe function;
`persephone.intent.resolve(value)` settles the current request successfully; and
`persephone.intent.reject(reason)` settles it with the `rejected` failure code. Prefer the
request-bound `request.resolve` and `request.reject` methods in callbacks. A handler **must**
settle every request. A handler that never
settles hangs its caller until the deadline; Persephone then sends a best-effort cancel, but cannot
stop work already running in the board.

Intent payloads are structured-cloned, kept in broker memory, and delivered once. They never enter
page state or disk, and a restored page does not receive the old payload again. This is a broker
policy, not an OS guarantee: memory can be paged and Chromium may keep its own caches. Delivery is
at-most-once; Persephone never re-delivers an intent. A timeout stops the platform waiting and sends
cancel; it does not stop the handler. Agents may retry, so work that needs idempotency must key on
`requestId`.

### Discovering and invoking capabilities

`persephone.capabilities.list()` returns the registrations visible in this renderer without opening
a handler. Each entry includes `handlerKey`, which distinguishes handlers that share one id:

```js
const available = await persephone.capabilities.list();
// [{ id: "acme.convert", version: 1, priority: 60,
//    handlerKey: "board:/work/acme", origin: "board", title: "Convert a document" }]
```

Call `persephone.capabilities.invoke(id, payload, { version, deadlineMs })` to resolve by id rather
than naming a handler. A board-originated result has `{ pageId, result }`; `pageId` is optional for
handlers that resolve without opening a page. The ten typed rejection codes are:

| Code | Meaning to the caller |
|---|---|
| `no-handler` | No declaration matches the id, pinned version, or filter; a headless winner is out of scope. |
| `untrusted` | The handler board was untrusted before or during the request. |
| `handler-closed` | The handler page/frame closed before settlement. |
| `crashed` | The handler frame errored or reloaded during the request. |
| `cancelled` | The caller cancelled, its page closed, or the renderer is tearing down. |
| `timeout` | The deadline elapsed; the platform stopped waiting and sent best-effort cancel. |
| `cycle` | Resolution would re-enter a handler already in the request chain or exceed the depth limit. |
| `payload-too-large` | A board-bound structured payload exceeds the inline 8 MiB cap. |
| `busy` | The selected handler has reached its outstanding-request limit. |
| `rejected` | The handler rejected the request, the payload could not be structured-cloned, or the transport failed without another typed code. |

Handle these errors rather than assuming an invocation succeeded:

```js
try {
    const reply = await persephone.capabilities.invoke("acme.convert", { source });
    render(reply.result);
} catch (error) {
    showError(`${error.code}: ${error.message}`);
}
```

### Content providers

Declare a provider in `contentProviders` and give it one or more URL schemes:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["service", "contentProviders"],
  "service": "scripts/service.mjs",
  "contentProviders": [{ "type": "acme/mem", "schemes": ["mem"] }]
}
```

The provider `type` **must contain `/`**. Un-namespaced types are reserved for the platform
(`file`, `cache`, `http`, `data`, `mneme`, and `guide`). A type is a persisted contract in page
state: renaming it does not migrate old descriptors and orphans pages that still name the old
type. Provider types and schemes have one owner. Among trusted boards, the first registration
wins; a later board loses and the refusal, including the current owner where applicable, is kept
in Board Info. A board cannot claim the reserved schemes `http`, `https`, `file`, `data`, `blob`,
`mneme`, or any scheme beginning with `persephone-`. `contentProviders` in `permissions` is
disclosure and lifecycle hygiene; the provider declaration itself is the functional registration
axis, unlike the service declaration's service-permission gate.

**Custom Editor fields (optional)** — only honored when the board is **trusted**:

- `fileMasks` (optional) — glob masks (matched against the file **name**) this board edits,
  e.g. `["*.drawio"]` or `["*.grid.json"]`. `*` = any run of chars, `?` = one char; a bare
  extension (`"drawio"` / `".drawio"`) is accepted and treated as `*.drawio`. A wildcard-free
  mask with a dot **inside** it is an exact **file name**, not an extension — `["DASHBOARD.md"]`
  claims files named exactly that (pair it with `folderMasks` to scope where). When set, the
  board appears in the editor **switch** for matching files.
- `folderMasks` (optional) — narrows `fileMasks` to files sitting in matching **folders**, e.g.
  `"fileMasks": ["DASHBOARD.md"], "folderMasks": ["*/tasks"]` claims `…/dev/tasks/DASHBOARD.md`
  but leaves every other `DASHBOARD.md` to its built-in editor. Omit for "any folder" (the default). Matched
  against the file's **parent folder**, case-insensitively, with either separator, and anchored
  at the **end** of the path — a mask is a folder-path *suffix*, so it need not spell out the
  drive. `*` and `?` stop at a separator, `**` crosses them: `*/tasks` = exactly one segment
  above `tasks`, `tasks` = a folder of that name at any depth, `**/dev/tasks` = `dev/tasks`
  anywhere, `c:/projects/acme/**` = anything *under* that tree (the tree root itself is not
  matched — add it as a second mask if you need it). Narrowing only: `folderMasks` with no
  `fileMasks` registers nothing. One exception, by design — the **file icon** ignores
  `folderMasks` (icon lookups have only a file name, no path), so every name-matching file
  shows this board's icon even outside the folder scope; only the editor that actually *opens*
  the file respects the scope.
- `contentMasks` (optional) — **regex** sources tested against the page's text **content**, so a
  board can claim a page that has no file name at all. `fileMasks` can only match a name; an
  **untitled, in-memory** page (an agent-generated document, a script's output, pasted JSON) has
  none, and content detection is how the built-in editors handle exactly that case. Declare the
  marker your format always carries, e.g.
  `"contentMasks": ["\"type\"\s*:\s*\"force-graph\""]`, and the board appears in the editor
  **switch** for any page whose content matches. Matching is case-insensitive, tested against the
  first 64 KB of the page, and a mask that is not a valid regex is silently ignored — so keep the
  pattern a short, distinctive marker rather than a full-document grammar.
  **Switch-option scope only:** content never decides which editor *opens a file*, so
  `editorPriority` does not apply here and a content match can never take a file away from its
  built-in editor. Independent of `fileMasks` — a board may declare `contentMasks` alone (and
  then claims no file names at all), or both.
- `editorPriority` (optional) — number; makes the board the **default** editor for its masks
  when it **strictly outranks** the built-in editor that also claims the file. Omit or `0` → the
  board is a switch option only and the built-in editor stays the default. The built-in ladder:
  Monaco `0` (the catch-all floor), Markdown Preview `10` (`.md` & friends), compound-name
  editors `20` (`*.grid.json`, `*.note.json`, `*.rest.json`, …), Drawing `50`, image /
  archive / video viewers `100`. So `1` is enough to beat Monaco on a plain text file, but a
  board claiming `DASHBOARD.md` needs **more than 10** to win over Markdown Preview — ties go
  to the built-in. When in doubt, `100` beats everything except the media viewers, and `200`
  beats those too.
- `editorName` (optional) — label shown on the editor-switch widget (falls back to `name`).
- `editorKind` (optional) — how Persephone backs this editor. Omit or `"simple"` (default) → the
  board gets the file path via `persephone.getFilePath()` and reads/writes it directly with
  `persephone.readFile()` / `writeFile()`. `"content-host"` → Persephone owns the file (pipe,
  encoding, encryption, auto-save, dirty tracking) and the board works through
  `persephone.host.getContent()` / `setContent()` instead. `"stream-host"` also lets Persephone
  own the pipe, but hands the board a URL through `persephone.host.streamUrl()` for ranged media
  or binary reads instead of text. It does not materialize a file or write a cache for this page.
  That is a broker policy, not an OS guarantee: memory can be paged and Chromium keeps its own
  caches, as roadmap §3.1a explains. Content-host and stream-host boards also edit non-local files
  (`https://`, inside archives, encrypted).
- `editorSources` (optional) — `"local"` (default) or `"any"`. Persephone opens more than plain
  local files: a file inside an archive (`archive.zip!doc.pdf`), an `http(s)` URL, an encrypted
  file. By default a **simple** board is offered only for a real local file, because the common
  shape — `readFile(await getFilePath())` — would break on a source with no readable path. Set
  `"any"` when your board can handle every source; `getFilePath()` then still hands you a readable
  **local** path (Persephone materializes the source into a cache file first), so you need **no
  source-specific code** — see *Opened as a custom editor* below for the two consequences you must
  handle. Ignored for `"content-host"` and `"stream-host"` boards, which always get every source.

**Direct-folder editor example:**

```json
{
  "folderEditorMasks": ["*/projects/*"],
  "folderEditorPriority": 200
}
```

`folderEditorMasks` claims the folder itself, not files inside it. When this board opens from a
matching Explorer folder, `boardRoot` is the board app's installed root, while `folderPath` is the
absolute directory the board claims and operates on. Await `persephone.getFolderPath()` for that
directory. Folder mode always leaves `getFilePath()` undefined; `editorKind: "content-host"` applies
only to the board's file association and does not create a content host for a folder claim.

Don't put secrets or trust flags here — a board is trusted by the user inside Persephone,
never by the manifest. (The board icon is **not** set here; see *Board icon* below.)

**Documentation field (optional)** — also only honored when the board is **trusted**:

- `guides` (optional) — a board-relative folder holding this board's own Markdown documentation,
  conventionally `"guides"`. Persephone mounts every `.md` under it into its guide system at
  `installed-boards/<board-folder-name>/…`, so the pages appear in the About guide tree under the
  top-level **installed-boards** branch, answer `F1` from the board's own pages, turn up in guide
  search, and are readable by an agent at `guides["installed-boards/<board>/<page>"]`. See
  *Ship your own documentation* below. An absolute path, a drive letter or a `..` segment is
  rejected — the folder must live inside the board.

## Mental model: frontend + backend + the `execute()` channel

- **Frontend** — `index.html` + `app.js` (+ any CSS/assets you add). Owns *all* UI
  and *all* state. This is what renders in the iframe.
- **Backend** — the scripts under `scripts/` (`.js`, `.py`, `.ps1`, `.sh`, …). They
  run as real OS processes with your privileges, and talk to the page over stdout.
- **Channel** — `persephone.execute(commandLine)`. The page calls a script, the
  script prints JSON to stdout, the page parses it and renders. That's the whole loop.

Persephone owns no board state and no board UI — it just wires the channel and shows
the page. Persistence (if you want any) is your choice: write a script that reads/
writes a file via `execute()`.

## The one method: `persephone.execute()`

```js
const handle = persephone.execute(commandLine, { cwd, env, shell });
```

`cwd` defaults to **this board folder**, so relative paths like `scripts/hello.js`
just work (and a script behaves the same if you run it standalone from here).

Consume the handle **one of two ways** (mixing them on one handle throws):

- **Buffered** — `await handle.getText()` / `getJson()` / `getBytes()`.
  `getJson()` rejects on a non-zero exit or a JSON parse error (the error carries
  `exitCode` and captured `stderr`).
- **Streaming** — `handle.on("stdout" | "stderr", chunk => …)`, `handle.on("exit", info => …)`,
  `handle.on("error", err => …)`. Plus `handle.write(...)`, `handle.endStdin()`, `handle.kill()`.

**Convention:** a backend script prints a single JSON document to stdout; the page
reads it with `getJson()`. See `app.js`'s `boardScript()` helper and `scripts/hello.js`.

### Returning data reliably when a script calls other tools

A bare `getJson()` assumes stdout contains **only** your JSON. That breaks as soon as
your script shells out to another tool that prints its own output (progress, banners,
its own JSON) — the mixed stream won't parse. Two complementary habits fix this:

1. **Logs → stderr, result → stdout.** Send any diagnostics to stderr (a separate
   stream, surfaced via `handle.on("stderr", …)`), and where you can, *capture* a
   sub-tool's output instead of letting it flow through (`out=$(tool)` in shell,
   `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True)` in Python, `execSync(cmd)` in node).

2. **Wrap the result in a marker** and let `getJson(pattern)` extract it. Emit the
   final JSON with a unique tag from the backend script:

   ```js
   console.log("@@RESULT@@" + JSON.stringify(result));          // node
   ```
   ```python
   print("@@RESULT@@" + json.dumps(result))                    # python
   ```
   ```sh
   echo "@@RESULT@@$json"                                       # shell
   ```

   Then pass that marker to `getJson()` on the page — it extracts the match (the
   **last** one, capture group 1) before parsing, and **still rejects on a non-zero
   exit with the captured stderr**:

   ```js
   const result = await persephone.execute(cmd).getJson(/@@RESULT@@(.*)/);
   ```

   For pretty-printed (multi-line) JSON, use an open/close pair with a dot-all regex:
   `getJson(/@@RESULT@@([\s\S]*?)@@END@@/)`. Pick your own tag and keep it identical on
   both sides. `getJson()` with no argument still parses the whole stdout (fine for
   scripts that print only JSON).

## Guaranteed Node runtime: `persephone.executeNode()`

`persephone.execute("node script.js")` only works if the **user** has Node installed —
a published board can't rely on that. `executeNode` runs a script on **Persephone's own
bundled Node runtime**, so it works on any machine with zero dependencies:

```js
const handle = persephone.executeNode(script, args?, { cwd, env, name });
```

- `script` — a path relative to the board folder (or absolute). Prefer **`.mjs`** for
  explicit ESM (boards ship no `package.json`).
- `args` — a `string[]` passed argv-style: **no shell**, so no quoting hazards (a value
  like `"a b"` arrives as one argument). The `shell` option is ignored.
- Returns the **same handle** as `execute()` — buffered getters, streaming,
  `write`/`endStdin`/`kill`, and `name`-based `getJobs()` re-association all work
  identically.
- The runtime is **Node 24** with **`node:sqlite` built in** (incl. FTS5) — no npm
  install needed for SQLite. A missing script fires the handle's `error` event.

## Declared module services: `manifest.service`

A declared service is the platform-owned counterpart to a page-owned Node job. The choice is:

```text
executeNode(): board-page child process; page-started; frame-lifetime by default.
service: platform-started utility process; lazy; supervised; usable with no page open.
```

Use `executeNode()` for work initiated by the visible board page. Use `service` for background or
platform-owned work that must survive a page reload, serve requests with no board page open, or
have supervised lifecycle status. The declaration is board-relative and must point to an ESM entry,
for example `"service": "scripts/service.mjs"`; the service starts with the board root as its
current working directory, resolves imports and `node_modules` from that board root, and runs in
Persephone's bundled utility-process Node runtime.

The service can use standard Node built-ins, including filesystem, networking, streams, crypto,
workers, and timers. It does not receive `electron`, `app`, `BrowserWindow`, `webContents`, or
`ipcMain`. Its environment is sanitized to Persephone's runtime allowlist plus
`PERSEPHONE_SERVICE=1` and `PERSEPHONE_BOARD_ROOT`; do not assume arbitrary shell/user variables.
The static service host injects `persephone.storage`, so use that adapter for the shared per-board
JSON store instead of opening `store.json` or inventing a persistence path. The frame uses the same
store through `persephone.storage`.

The frame reaches the service through structured-clone request/reply messages:

```js
const result = await persephone.service.request({ op: "refresh", value });
await persephone.storage.set("last-result", result);
```

Requests start the service lazily and may reject with readable lifecycle errors such as
`untrusted`, `service-not-declared`, `permission-denied`, `service-busy`, `service-timeout`,
`service-exited`, or `service-failed`; catch them and render a useful result. A service's stdout
and stderr are captured in `<boardRoot>/ui.log`, which is the first place to inspect when an ESM
import, handshake, request, or dependency fails. Service status is visible in `app.boards.list()`
as `service.state`, `reason`, `pid`, `startedAt`, and `restartCount`. The host starts, supervises,
restart-budgets, and stops the process on untrust; the service must not restart itself.

### Service-only provider registration

`persephone.providers.register(type, implementation)` is available only inside the declared
module service. Provider implementations contain functions; those functions cannot cross the
board frame's structured-clone RPC, so registering them from page JavaScript is rejected. The
service implementation has this shape:

```js
persephone.providers.register("acme/mem", {
  writable: false,
  readBinary: async (config) => new Uint8Array(/* bounded bytes */),
  writeBinary: async (config, data) => {},       // only when writable is true
  stat: async (config) => ({ exists: true, size: 0, mtime: "..." }),
  watch: (config, onChange) => () => {},
});
```

`readBinary(config)` returns `Uint8Array`; `writeBinary(config, data)` receives bytes;
`stat(config)` returns `{ exists, size?, mtime? }`; and `watch(config, onChange)` returns a
disposer. Omit unsupported optional methods. Read and write payloads are bounded by the platform
(currently 256 MiB); this API is whole-resource buffered I/O. In particular, `ProxyProvider`
does not implement `createReadStream`, so a `Range` request for a board provider falls back to a
buffered read.

### Resident backend server (the key pattern)

Because the handle keeps stdin streaming, spawn **one** long-lived script per session and
feed it jobs as JSON lines instead of paying a spawn per operation:

```js
const srv = persephone.executeNode("scripts/db-server.js", [dbPath], { name: "db" });
srv.on("stdout", chunk => handleJsonLine(chunk));   // {id, columns, rows} | {id, error}
srv.write(JSON.stringify({ id: 1, sql }) + "\n");   // per query — no spawn, db stays open
```

One ~150 ms spawn when the board opens; afterwards each operation costs only its own work
(e.g. the SQLite query against a warm page cache). Pair with `setBoardBusy(true)` so the
server survives a board reload, and re-attach by `name` via `getJobs()` (see below). Board
close reaps the child.

## Integration tier (in-app effects `execute()` can't express)

### Navigation returns

When a third-party site must return to this board, mint one opaque URL and pass that exact value to
the site's return/redirect option. There is no pattern argument and no way for a board to claim an
arbitrary real origin:

```js
const returnUrl = await persephone.navigation.createReturnUrl();
const stop = persephone.navigation.onReturn(({ url, query, hash }) => {
    const selected = query.item?.[0];
    const library = hash.addLibrary?.[0];
    console.log({ url, selected, library });
});
thirdParty.start({ returnUrl });
// stop(); // unsubscribe when the board no longer needs returns
```

`url` is the complete returned URL. `query` and `hash` are plain records with array values;
duplicate keys are preserved in order, a key without a value is `""`, and percent-encoding is
decoded once. This API requires bridge `1.11.0` or newer (`minBridgeVersion: "1.11.0"`) and is
available to trusted or bundled boards. Claims belong to the current board frame: disposing or
reloading the frame invalidates them, so a reloaded document must mint a new URL. A late return is
consumed and the browser navigation is restored when possible, but it is never delivered to a
replacement board or frame.

**The site must open the return URL in a new tab or window** (Excalidraw does this by asking for
`?target=_blank`, so the library site calls `window.open(returnUrl)`). The minted host is under the
reserved `.invalid` suffix and can never resolve, so a site that navigates to it *in place* dies at
DNS before Persephone sees anything: the return is lost and that tab is left on a browser error
page. Persephone closes the tab the return created and leaves the tab the user was reading alone.

### `persephone.call(path, options?)`

Trusted Boards can read and update the AiVision tree through the page that hosts the Board. The
hosting page is stable even if the user activates another tab. Calls always use `hints: "never"`,
return a JSON-safe shaped value, and reject `Error` on resolver, transport, timeout, serialization,
or trust failures. Existing descriptor restrictions still apply, including private browser pages.
The bridge exposes the renderer-side page/app tree only; process-wide `main.*` and `windows[i].*`
are MCP call-tool paths and are not available through `persephone.call()`. The `boards` namespace
provides local board inventory and lifecycle operations; `tools` provides registered Agent Tools.
Tool execution runs with the user's privileges and exposes environment-variable names only. Trust,
board registration, and toolset registration remain user-mediated, so a call can request those flows
but never silently grants them.

```js
const source = await persephone.call("page.grouped.content");
const matches = [...source.matchAll(new RegExp(pattern, flags))]
    .map((match) => ({ match: match[0], index: match.index }));
await persephone.call("page.grouped.content", {
    value: JSON.stringify(matches, null, 2),
});
```

Pass `args` to invoke the final method, `value` to assign a writable property, or `maxLength` to
bound string shaping. Programmatic board calls are unbounded by default so binary/data strings are
not silently clipped; an explicit `maxLength` is still honored. `args` and `value` cannot be combined. See the bundled regex verification
Board under `assets/board-call-regex/` for a complete Run/Write example.

Append `.$describe` to a node path when a program needs the descriptor as data rather than prose:
`{ path, kind, summary, members[], children[], overview?, help?, identity?, restricted? }`.
It follows the same walk as `$help`, must be the final segment, and describes a restricted node
itself while still blocking its descendants. `$help` remains the better path for agent prose;
`$describe` is for a tree view, generated client, or test harness. Describe a node, not a leaf
value: `page.editor.$describe` works, while `page.content.$describe` does not.

- `persephone.openContent({ editor, language, title, content })` → `Promise<string>` — create a
  **new in-memory, untitled Persephone page in another editor** and resolve to its page id. This is
  the board equivalent of the script API's `pages.addEditorPage(...)`, and the right call whenever
  the content lives in the board's memory rather than in a file `openRawLink` could point at (a
  rendered Markdown summary, an extracted subgraph, a table to open in the JSON grid). `editor` is a
  registered editor id (`"md-view"`, `"grid-json"`, `"monaco"`, `"mermaid-view"`, …);
  `language` defaults to `"plaintext"`, `title` to `"untitled"`.
  ```js
  const pageId = await persephone.openContent({
      editor: "md-view", language: "markdown", title: "Node report", content: markdown,
  });
  ```
  It **rejects** with a readable message for an unknown editor id or language, a standalone editor
  that cannot be built this way, another board's id, or content over 16 M characters — handle the
  rejection, don't fire and forget. It is **create-only**: the id it returns belongs to a page the
  board just made, and there is no counterpart call to read, list, navigate, close, or modify any
  other page, so `persephone.call` keeps its scoping to the page hosting this board.
- `persephone.openRawLink(href, options?)` — open a file/URL in a new Persephone page. Pass
  `{ editor }` (e.g. `{ editor: "md-view" }`) to request a specific editor — useful to open a
  Markdown doc rendered rather than as source; falls back to the default editor when omitted/unmatched.
  An **image `data:` URL** with `{ editor: "image.edit" }` requests the image-edit capability and
  opens the image as a **new editable drawing** (rasterize your view to a PNG data URL first).
  - **External links are auto-routed for you.** A plain `<a href="https://…">` click inside a
    board would otherwise navigate the board frame itself to a URL its `board://` origin can't
    load, blanking the board. Persephone intercepts anchor clicks (and middle-clicks) and routes
    any link that leaves the board's own origin through `openRawLink` automatically — no board
    code needed. Relative and `#fragment` links resolve against the board and navigate in-frame
    as normal. To handle a link yourself instead, call `e.preventDefault()` in your own click
    handler first (the auto-router stands down when the event is already handled).
  - **A default right-click menu is provided for you.** Persephone renders a themed context menu
    inside your board — no code needed: _Open Link_ / _Copy Link_ on links, _Open Image in New
    Tab_ / _Copy Image_ / _Save Image As…_ on images, _Cut_ / _Copy_ / _Paste_ in text fields, and
    _Copy_ on a text selection. To show your own menu instead, call `e.preventDefault()` on the
    `contextmenu` event in your handler (same opt-out as the link router and Ctrl+S).
- `persephone.notify(message, type)` — toast (`"info" | "success" | "warning" | "error"`).
- `persephone.openFileDialog(params)` / `saveFileDialog(params)` / `openFolderDialog(params)`
  — native dialogs; each returns a path you hand to `execute()`.
- `persephone.readFile(path, options?)` / `writeFile(path, data, options?)` — read/write a file
  directly, no backend script needed. A **relative** `path` resolves against the board folder (the
  same default as `execute()`'s cwd); an absolute path reads/writes anywhere. `writeFile` creates
  parent folders. Both return Promises and reject on error. Three encodings:
  - **`"utf8"`** (default) — a plain string.
  - **`"binary"`** — a **`Uint8Array`** of the raw bytes. **Use this for any binary file** (an
    image, a PDF, a zip, a spreadsheet). It hands the bytes straight to your parser with no
    conversion, and it is the only way to read a file over ~400 MB, because base64 of one exceeds
    V8's maximum string length. Requires app **4.0.21+** — declare `"minAppVersion": "4.0.21"` in
    `board-manifest.json` and Persephone will refuse to run the board on anything older, so no
    runtime check is needed.
  - **`"base64"`** — a base64 string. Correct when you genuinely want base64 (building a `data:`
    URI); a poor way to move bytes. Measured on a 20 MB file: ~65 ms of pure conversion (`atob`
    plus a per-byte decode) and roughly 3x the transient memory of the binary path.
  ```js
  const bytes = await persephone.readFile(await persephone.getFilePath(), { encoding: "binary" });
  const workbook = XLSX.read(bytes, { type: "array" });   // no atob, no copy loop
  ```
  Ideal for persisting small board state (column layout, last filter, selected item) and loading a
  board-local config:
  ```js
  // persist UI state
  await persephone.writeFile("state.json", JSON.stringify(state));
  // restore it next launch (handle first-run "file not found")
  let state = {};
  try { state = JSON.parse(await persephone.readFile("state.json")); } catch {}
  ```
- `persephone.getFilePath()` → `Promise<string | undefined>` — when this board is opened as a
  **custom editor** for a file (associated via `fileMasks` in `board-manifest.json`), this resolves
  to that file's **absolute path**; read/write it with `persephone.readFile()` / `writeFile()`. It
  resolves to `undefined` for a board opened plainly. Safe to `await` at any time — it waits for the
  host handshake, so you never race a missing value:
  ```js
  const filePath = await persephone.getFilePath();
  if (filePath) {
      const content = await persephone.readFile(filePath);
      // …render / edit, then persephone.writeFile(filePath, updated) to save
  }
  ```
  The path is **always local and always readable**, whatever the file really was. For an archive
  entry or an `http(s)` URL (which reach you only with `"editorSources": "any"`) Persephone reads
  the source through its content pipe and hands you a cache file named after it, so one code path
  serves every source. Two consequences, and a board declaring `"any"` must handle both:
  ```js
  // 1. It can be SLOW — a URL completes only after the whole download. Don't make your UI
  //    wait on it if there is anything else to do first.
  const pending = persephone.getFilePath();
  buildUi();                       // runs while the source is still being fetched
  // 2. It can REJECT — missing archive entry, HTTP failure. Distinct from `undefined`,
  //    which just means "not opened for a file".
  let filePath;
  try { filePath = await pending; }
  catch (err) { showError(err.message); return; }   // never leave a blank frame
  ```
  Materialized files are **read-only**: writing to the cache path does not write back to the
  original source.

- `persephone.getFolderPath()` → `Promise<string | undefined>` — the absolute directory claimed by
  a direct-folder editor, or `undefined` for plain boards and file-only openings. It waits for the
  same host handshake as `getFilePath()`. This is separate from `boardRoot`, the folder containing
  the board app, and from the file-only `getFilePath()` value.

### Expose a board model to agents

> Full authoring reference: the **AI Vision** guide — `guides.agents["ai-vision"]`, or the
> `persephone://guides/ai-vision` resource. It covers the descriptor contract field by field, the
> `refresh()` shape rule, per-frame element registration, and a verification checklist. The summary
> below is enough for a simple model.

Give the board a named model by attaching an AiVision descriptor to an object and publishing it
through `persephone.aiVision.expose(root)`. The descriptor supplies the shape an agent can discover:
`kind`, `summary`, `members`, and optionally `help`, `elements`, `provide`, and `summarize`.
Persephone then provides `$help`, `$describe`, `helpSearch`, hints, argument validation, property
writes, method calls, `elements`, and `highlight` over `pages[i].editor.app`.

Use `createElements` for the board's curated controls. A declaration can name a secondary `view`; a
highlight for that control opens and targets the corresponding view's frame:

```js
const declarations = [
    { name: "save", purpose: "Save the current item.", selector: '[data-name="save"]', view: "main" },
    { name: "notes", purpose: "Edit notes.", selector: '[data-name="notes"]', view: "notes" },
];
const elements = persephone.aiVision.createElements(declarations);

const model = { aiVision: {
    kind: "ProjectBoard",
    summary: "The board's project model.",
    members: [
        { name: "items", kind: "property", summary: "Current project items." },
        ...elements.members,
    ],
    elements: declarations,
    provide: elements.provide,
} };
const remote = persephone.aiVision.expose(model);
```

Only the main frame registers the model with Persephone. The published shape is a snapshot, so call
the returned remote's `refresh()` after changing its structure or metadata. `refresh()` also tells
the host that the board shape changed; the agent should read `pages[i].editor.app` again after the
resulting `shape-changed` event. A board can send a short board-authored message with the same
remote:

```js
remote.notify("The import finished.");
```

Only trusted boards deliver `notify(text)` to the agent. The text is one line, at most 512
characters, and accepted notifications are limited to five per rolling minute in the renderer
window. The agent sees the event labelled as board-written. This does not replace
`persephone.notify(text, type)`, which remains a toast. A board's exposed state
is as visible to an agent as what the board already shows on screen; never expose secrets. The todo
board is the worked example for this `aiVision` surface: `expose()` probes `index(0)` once to derive
the shape of an indexed item, so a board whose collections are empty during asynchronous
registration must call the returned remote's `refresh()` when they first become non-empty, or
`items[0]` will not resolve for an agent. Agent-facing methods must not block on an in-board confirm
dialog; keep confirmation in the interactive UI and make the exposed method complete immediately.

### Content-host boards — `persephone.host.*`

When your board sets `"editorKind": "content-host"` in the manifest, **Persephone owns the file**,
not you. It handles the pipe, encoding, encryption, the auto-save cache, and dirty tracking; your
board never touches a path or calls `readFile`/`writeFile` for the edited file. Instead you work
with the content through `persephone.host.*`:

- `persephone.host.getContent()` → `Promise<string>` — the current content. Safe to `await` at any
  time — it waits for the host handshake and the first content snapshot internally, so calling it
  first thing in your script (before anything else has run) is fine; you never race a missing value.
- `persephone.host.setContent(content)` — replace the content and mark the file **modified**
  (schedules the auto-save cache), exactly like a user edit in Monaco. A `getContent()` right after
  returns what you just wrote (read-your-own-write).
- `persephone.host.onContentChange(cb)` → unsubscribe fn — `cb(content, language?)` fires whenever
  the content changes **elsewhere** (e.g. the user switched to Monaco, edited, and switched back).
  Your own `setContent` does **not** re-fire it. Registers at any time, boot ordering included.
- `persephone.host.getLanguage()` → `Promise<string | undefined>` — the host's Monaco language id.
- `persephone.host.save()` — save through the pipe now (optional; see Ctrl+S below).

```js
// content-host board: render current content, re-render on external change
render(await persephone.host.getContent());
persephone.host.onContentChange((content) => render(content));   // keep the render() resilient to
                                                                 // transient/invalid input
```

**Saving is automatic.** Persephone injects a `Ctrl+S` (⌘S) handler that saves the host for you —
you write no save code. If your board wants custom save behavior, add your own key handler and call
`e.preventDefault()`; Persephone's fallback then stands down. `persephone.host.save()` is available
for an in-board Save button.

Because the host is shared, a content-host board and Monaco (or Grid) **switch back and forth on the
same file with no reload and no data loss** — the classic source-edit / live-preview pairing. On a
plain (non-content-host) board `persephone.host.getContent()` / `getLanguage()` reject (after the
handshake answers the question) and a registered `onContentChange` callback never fires, so
feature-detect with a `try`/`catch` around `getContent()` if a board can open either way.

**Clipboard:** use `persephone.clipboard.writeImage(data)` for encoded image bytes (`Uint8Array` or
`ArrayBuffer`) or `persephone.clipboard.writeText(text)` for text. These methods write through
Electron's native clipboard and do not require the board document to be focused. A click on
Persephone's own toolbar can leave the board frame unfocused, in which case
`navigator.clipboard.write*` rejects with `"Document is not focused"`; the Web Clipboard API is
still suitable when the board document is focused and the browser gesture requirements are met.
Only remote *network* is blocked (by the CSP — see *Libraries & assets* below).

### Stream-host boards — `persephone.host.streamUrl()`

With `"editorKind": "stream-host"`, Persephone owns the pipe and gives the board an
origin-local URL rather than text or a materialized file:

```js
const url = await persephone.host.streamUrl();
const response = await fetch(url, { headers: { Range: "bytes=0-1048575" } });
console.log(response.status, response.headers.get("Content-Range"));
```

`streamUrl()` is available to both `stream-host` and `content-host` pages and returns a
`board://<host>/__pipe/<pageId>` URL with `Range` support. A stream-host page does not write its
source to disk. This is a broker policy, not an OS guarantee: memory may be paged and Chromium
may keep its own caches. That differs from `editorSources: "any"`, which solves non-local input by
copying the source into a cache file and returning that local path through `getFilePath()`.

The pipe can range-read platform providers and falls back to buffering when needed. A board
provider's `readBinary()` is still whole-resource: `ProxyProvider` has no `createReadStream`, so
the range is buffered before it is returned to the board.

## Secondary views & shared state

A board isn't limited to its main page — it can contribute one or more **secondary views**:
extra sidebar panels, each its own `board://` iframe over the **same board**. Every frame
(main + secondaries) shares one state object that Persephone owns and mirrors into all of
them, so they stay synchronized. This is how you build editor-style boards: a main view plus
a coordinated "lists / details / outline" sidebar.

### Declare views — manifest or at runtime

Statically, in `board-manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "secondaryViews": [
    { "id": "lists",  "title": "Lists" },
    { "id": "detail", "html": "detail.html", "title": "Detail" }
  ]
}
```

- `id` — stable key for the view (must not contain `::`).
- `html` — the view's entry file. **Defaults to `index.html`**, so one file can serve every
  view (branch on `persephone.view`, below); or point it at a dedicated file.
- `title` — the sidebar panel's label. (The panel icon is always the board's own icon — there
  is no per-view icon.)

Or dynamically, from any frame:

```js
persephone.setSecondaryViews([{ id: "lists", title: "Lists" }]);
persephone.setSecondaryViews([]);   // remove all
```

Navigating the board's main view away removes its panels and disposes the board — secondary
views don't keep it on the page.

### One HTML, many roles — `persephone.view`

Each frame knows its role synchronously at load via `persephone.view`: `"main"` for the main
view, or the view's `id` for a secondary frame. Branch on it to serve everything from
`index.html`:

```js
if (persephone.view === "main") renderMain();
else renderSidebar(persephone.view);   // e.g. "lists"
```

### Shared state — `persephone.state.*`

The frames coordinate through a shared state object (Persephone-owned, authoritative),
available on **every** board — main and secondary frames alike:

```js
// Declare defaults + which keys persist (opt-in — below). Call once, from the main view.
persephone.state.init({ selected: null, filter: "all" }, { restorableKeys: ["selected"] });

const s   = await persephone.state.get();     // current state (Promise: first snapshot, then cached)
persephone.state.set({ selected: "work" });   // replace
persephone.state.merge({ filter: "open" });    // shallow-merge
const off = persephone.state.onChange((s) => renderFrom(s)); // any frame's change; returns unsubscribe fn
```

- **`onChange` is the source of truth.** A write round-trips through Persephone and comes back
  to every frame (including the writer), so treat `onChange` like React `setState` — render
  from it; don't assume `set`/`merge` applied synchronously.
- **Opt-in persistence.** Only the keys listed in `state.init(defaults, { restorableKeys })`
  are saved to the page and restored on app restart / board reload. Everything else is
  in-memory only — stash large or transient state freely without bloating the open-pages file.

### Example — a list + detail pairing

```js
// index.html / app.js — the main view
persephone.state.init({ selectedId: null }, { restorableKeys: ["selectedId"] });
persephone.state.onChange((s) => highlightSelected(s.selectedId));

// lists.html (or index.html branched on persephone.view === "lists") — a sidebar view
row.onclick = () => persephone.state.merge({ selectedId: row.dataset.id });
```

The bundled Demo board has a live **Secondary Views** showcase demonstrating both the
one-file (`persephone.view`) and dedicated-file styles — see *More examples* below.

## Long-running processes: `setBoardBusy()` / `getBoardBusy()` / `getJobs()`

By default, everything a board spawned is **killed when the board unloads** — the user
navigating its page to a document, or a board reload. For a board that starts dev
servers (or any process that must keep running), opt out with the **busy** flag:

- `persephone.setBoardBusy(true)` — declare "my processes must outlive me". While busy,
  unloading the board (navigation, reload) keeps its processes running. They are still
  killed when the page/tab closes, when Persephone quits, or after you call
  `setBoardBusy(false)` and the board unloads.
- `persephone.getBoardBusy()` → `Promise<boolean>` — the flag survives the board's own
  reload; read it on startup to know you should re-enter "running" mode.
- `persephone.getJobs()` → `Promise<[{ jobId, command, name, kill(), write(), endStdin() }]>` —
  this board's LIVE jobs, including ones spawned by a previous lifetime of the board.
  Surviving jobs are **control-only**: `kill()`/`write()` work, but there is no
  stdout/stderr/exit streaming (their output went to the previous lifetime; output
  produced while the board was unloaded is dropped). Poll `getJobs()` to notice a job
  exited.

**Name your long-running jobs** — the name is the re-association key after a reload
(the board's own JS state, including old handles, does not survive):

```js
// start
persephone.execute("npm run dev", { name: "backend" });
persephone.setBoardBusy(true);

// on every board startup — the reinit contract
if (await persephone.getBoardBusy()) {
    const jobs = await persephone.getJobs();
    const backend = jobs.find(j => j.name === "backend");
    if (backend) showRunning(backend);            // Stop button → backend.kill()
    if (jobs.length === 0) persephone.setBoardBusy(false); // nothing lives — reset
}

// stop
backend.kill();
persephone.setBoardBusy(false);
```

## Theme: the `--p-*` contract

Persephone injects its palette as CSS variables on `<html>` and keeps them live
across theme switches — style everything with them so the board matches the app.
The variables are defined **before the first paint**, so a board loads already themed
(no flash) — you can rely on `var(--p-bg)` etc. resolving from the very first frame:

```css
body { background: var(--p-bg); color: var(--p-text); }
button { background: var(--p-accent); color: var(--p-accent-text); border-radius: var(--p-radius-md); }
```

Your board ships with **`board-base.css`** (linked first in `index.html`). It applies
sensible defaults for you — page background/text, a **monospace default font**,
**themed scrollbars**, a **themed focus ring**, and **Persephone-style checkboxes**
(any native `<input type="checkbox">` renders as the app's rounded-square + check,
driven by the `--p-*` tokens) — all from the `--p-*` contract. It also carries an
**opt-in chrome layer** (`.p-toolbar`, `.p-btn`, `.p-input`, …) covered in the next
section. Build your own styles on top (or edit it). The list below is the full
palette + metric set you can use:

- **Colors** (theme-dependent, update live): `--p-bg`, `--p-panel`, `--p-bg-dark`,
  `--p-overlay`, `--p-hover`, `--p-tree-selection`, `--p-border`, `--p-border-light`,
  `--p-text`, `--p-text-muted`, `--p-text-strong`, `--p-accent`, `--p-accent-text`,
  `--p-accent-hover`, `--p-selection-bg`, `--p-selection-text`, `--p-link`,
  `--p-error`, `--p-success`, `--p-warning`, `--p-scrollbar`, `--p-scrollbar-thumb`,
  `--p-shadow`.
  - To render **Persephone-style chrome** (title bars, sidebar panels, grid headers):
    `--p-bg-dark` is the app's chrome surface (darker than `--p-panel`), `--p-hover`
    the list/button hover background, `--p-tree-selection` the selected-row background.
- **Metrics** (constants): `--p-space-*`, `--p-gap-*`, `--p-radius-*`, `--p-size-*`,
  `--p-font-*` (e.g. `--p-space-md`, `--p-radius-sm`, `--p-font-base`).

### Toolbars and buttons — use the `.p-*` classes, don't invent your own

`board-base.css` ships ready-made chrome carrying the app's exact control metrics.
Use it rather than styling a toolbar yourself — the sizes below are what make a board
look built into Persephone instead of embedded in it:

```html
<div class="p-toolbar">
    <span class="p-toolbar-title">Dev Dashboard</span>
    <span class="p-sep"></span>
    <button class="p-btn selected">Active</button>
    <button class="p-btn">All</button>
    <input class="p-input" placeholder="Search…" />
    <span class="p-spacer"></span>
    <button class="p-btn primary">Refresh</button>
</div>
```

| Class | What it is |
|-------|-----------|
| `.p-toolbar` | 30px bar on `--p-bg-dark` (+1px rule). Add `data-orientation="vertical"` for a side rail. |
| `.p-btn` | 26px button — **24px inside a `.p-toolbar`**, automatically. Modifiers: `primary` (accent fill), `ghost`, `danger`, `link`, `selected`, `icon` (square), `sm` (24px anywhere), `md` (keep 26px in a bar), `on-dark`. |
| `.p-input` / `.p-select` | Field aligned with the buttons beside it — 26px, 24px in a toolbar. Same `sm` / `md` modifiers. |
| `.p-sep` | Hairline between toolbar groups. |
| `.p-spacer` | Pushes everything after it to the right edge. |
| `.p-toolbar-title` | Caption text in a bar (board name, breadcrumb) — not a control. |

They are opt-in: a bare `<button>` is untouched, so a vendored library's own controls
keep their styling.

**If you do write your own chrome CSS, keep these numbers.** They are the whole
difference between a compact board and a bloated one:

- **Toolbar: 30px tall, holding 24px controls** (31px with the bottom rule). A
  comfortable-looking `padding: 8px 12px` produces a **45px** bar, half again too tall.
- **A toolbar button is the SMALL tier: `height: 24px; padding: 0 4px;
  font-size: 12px`.** This is the one that looks fine in isolation and wrong in place —
  Persephone's own editor toolbars are built from small buttons, so a bar of 26px
  medium buttons reads as oversized the moment it sits under the app's chrome. 26px is
  the *page and dialog* size.
- **Toolbar surface: `--p-bg-dark`.** App chrome is *darker* than the page, never
  lighter. `--p-panel` is a content surface — using it is what makes a board's toolbar
  look pale and web-like next to the app.
- **Controls: fixed `height`, horizontal padding only.** Vertical padding on a button
  is the single most common cause of an oversized bar.
- **Radius 4px (`--p-radius-md`), gap 4px between controls, 6px inside a button,
  icons 16px** — and use the *same* radius on every button in a bar.

Outside a bar (a form, a dialog, a page action) the medium tier is right: 26px,
`padding: 0 8px`, 14px text.

Also mirrored in JS — for colors you set from JS (e.g. a chart library):

- `persephone.theme` (`{ id, isDark, vars }`) and `persephone.tokens` — a **snapshot at
  page load**. Correct on every (re)load, but they do **not** update on an in-session
  theme switch (the bridge copies them once into the page).
- `persephone.getTheme()` / `persephone.getTokens()` — the **live** palette/tokens, always
  the current theme (a function call crosses the bridge fresh each time).
- `persephone.onThemeChange(cb)` — fires once immediately, then on every switch; the
  callback **argument** is the live palette.

**Switching themes while testing.** The app's theme shortcuts — `Ctrl+Alt+]` (next) and
`Ctrl+Alt+[` (previous) — work while focus is inside the board frame, so you can flip through
themes to check your styling without clicking out to the app first. Persephone forwards them
out of the frame for you; if your board binds either combo itself, call `preventDefault()` in
your own handler and the forwarding stands down (same opt-out as `Ctrl+S` and the context menu).

**Graph colors (`--p-graph-*`).** Persephone also publishes its 14 force-graph colors — canvas
background, node / border / link fills in default, highlight, selected and special variants, the
label plate and text, and the group outline — as `--p-graph-bg`, `--p-graph-node-default`,
`--p-graph-node-highlight`, `--p-graph-node-selected`, `--p-graph-node-special`,
`--p-graph-border-default`, `--p-graph-border-highlight`, `--p-graph-border-selected`,
`--p-graph-border-special`, `--p-graph-link-default`, `--p-graph-link-selected`,
`--p-graph-label-bg`, `--p-graph-label-text` and `--p-graph-group-border`. They are per-theme
values tuned across all ten themes — a palette derived from the general `--p-*` set loses that
fidelity. Because a `<canvas>` cannot consume `var(...)`, the same values arrive as concrete
strings on `persephone.getTheme().graph`, keyed by the camelCased suffix (`bg`, `nodeDefault`,
`nodeHighlight`, `nodeSelected`, `nodeSpecial`, `borderDefault`, `borderHighlight`,
`borderSelected`, `borderSpecial`, `linkDefault`, `linkSelected`, `labelBg`, `labelText`,
`groupBorder`). `onThemeChange` delivers the graph family too — re-read it on every fire and
repaint, never cache it across a switch.

```js
persephone.onThemeChange((theme) => {
    ctx.fillStyle = theme.graph.nodeDefault;
    ctx.strokeStyle = theme.graph.linkDefault;
    repaint();
});
```

**Re-theming a JS-colored component (charts, diagrams):** read the palette from the
`onThemeChange` argument (or `getTheme()`) and re-apply on each fire — never cache
`persephone.theme.vars` and reuse it across a switch, or your colors will go stale.

## Libraries & assets — vendor them locally

A board is a **local, offline-first app**, and its CSP **forbids remote network**:
`connect-src 'self'` blocks CDN scripts, stylesheets, fonts, and any `fetch`
to another host. So when you use a component library (grids, charts, markdown, icons,
fonts, …), **download it into the board folder and reference it relatively** — never
link a CDN.

- Put files under the board folder, e.g. `lib/av-grid.umd.js`, `lib/av-grid.css`,
  and load them with **relative paths**: `<script src="./lib/av-grid.umd.js"></script>`,
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./lib/av-grid.css" />`. A relative path resolves
  under the page's `board://` origin automatically (subfolders included) — just like the
  board's own `./app.js` / `./style.css`. You don't write the scheme yourself (and never
  the two-slash `board://lib/…` form — the URL parser would read `lib` as the host).
- **Do not** use `https://…cdn…` URLs in `<script>` / `<link>` / `@import` / `fetch()` —
  they are blocked and the board will silently fail to load the dependency.
- Bundle fonts and images in the folder too (or inline images as `data:` URIs).

This keeps the board self-contained: it works with no network connection and won't
break if a CDN changes or disappears. (As an agent: download the library files into
the board folder before referencing them.)

**Which library?** The recommended-components catalog
(`boards-assets/manifest.json`, link at the bottom of this file) lists a pre-tested,
theme-checked library per job — grid, charts, date picker, select, markdown, diagrams,
split panes, drag-reorder, tooltips, modals — with vendor URLs, load order, and the skin
to fetch. Prefer a catalog component over an arbitrary one you pick yourself.

### Tabular data — use av-grid

For **anything grid-shaped**, the default is **[av-grid](https://github.com/andriy-viyatyk/av-grid)**
(npm `av-grid`), not Tabulator. It is a port of Persephone's own internal grid (VAGrid), so
it is native to the app: it matches the built-in grid editors' look and keyboard behaviour,
and it renders more smoothly than Tabulator — noticeably so **even on small datasets**. The
catalog is verified against av-grid 2.12.1: its text filters support per-column operators
(`contains`, `equals`, `startsWith`, `blank`, `notBlank`), hosts can own filtering and sorting,
`treeColumn` provides a gutter over flat rows, and `pinned: "left"` / `"right"` provides
leading/trailing sticky data columns.

- **No skin to fetch, no theme code.** Every `--avg-*` token falls back to its `--p-*`
  counterpart, so the grid is themed on arrival and a live theme switch re-tints it with
  **zero JavaScript** — nothing to re-apply in `onThemeChange`.
- **Vendor:** `av-grid.css` + `av-grid.umd.cjs` from jsDelivr into `lib/`, **renaming the
  `.cjs` to `.js`** so it loads as a classic script. It exposes `window.AVGrid`; the class
  is `AVGrid.AVGrid`.
- **Read the API doc first:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andriy-viyatyk/av-grid/main/docs/api.md
  — one complete file, written for an agent, with a *"Driving the grid from an agent"*
  section on the `pages[pageId].editor` path and a DOM contract for selectors.
- **Load order:** `board-base.css` → `lib/av-grid.css` → your own `<style>`, and pass
  `injectStyles: false` to `create()` — otherwise the grid appends its stylesheet *after*
  your page and out-orders your overrides. Give the grid host a **definite height** (a host
  with no height renders blank; `getState().viewport.width === 0` says so), and with
  `filterBar: true` give `.avg-grid-wrap` `height: 100%`.
- **Reach for Tabulator only** when the board genuinely needs something av-grid does not
  have: variable row heights, row grouping, a true tree-data engine or nested rows,
  three-or-more-level nested column headers (av-grid's `Column.group` supplies one group band),
  pagination or server-side paging, remote data transport/fetching, footer calculations,
  built-in export (CSV/XLSX/PDF/print), drag-to-reorder **rows**, responsive column collapse,
  undo/redo, arbitrary or interleaved data-column freezing, or Tabulator's ready-made formatters
  (progress bar, star rating, traffic light).

## Errors & the log

Report failures with `persephone.notify(message, "error")` — they're toasted **and**
appended to **`ui.log`** in this folder (choose **… → Open board log** in the in-board toolbar
to open it). Persephone also logs board *load* failures there automatically: navigation
errors, CSP violations, and uncaught script errors / unhandled rejections — and it mirrors
every **`console.error`** / **`console.warn`** from the board's frames into the log
(`console.log`/`info` are not mirrored), so runtime problems your code or a library reports
via the console are reviewable without DevTools. The log starts
fresh on every load (it holds only the current board lifetime, beginning with a
`board loaded` line), so opening it after a clean load shows no errors. Keep your `catch`
blocks calling `notify(..., "error")` so problems are reviewable.

## Board icon (optional)

Put an `icon.svg`, `icon.png`, or `icon.ico` in this board folder to set the board's
icon — shown in the Persephone tab (when the board is open), the boards list, and the
sidebar. First match wins (SVG preferred). Without one, a default glyph is used.

## Editing & reload

Boards do **not** auto-reload when you edit their files. After editing `index.html`,
`app.js`, or `.css`, apply the changes with **… → Reload board** in the in-board
toolbar. When an AI agent is driving the board, it reloads with
`pages[pageId].editor.reload()` — the path returns only after the reloaded main frame has
finished loading, so `pages[pageId].editor.snapshot()` right after it sees the new content.

**`board-manifest.json` is the exception — a reload does not pick it up.** Persephone reads a
board's manifest when the board becomes trusted and caches it from then on, so a manifest edit
(new `fileMasks` or `folderEditorMasks`, changed `folderMasks`, `editorPriority`, or
`folderEditorPriority`, or adding `editorSources`) takes effect only after
toggling the board's trust off and on, or restarting the app. A reload that appears to ignore a
manifest change is this, not a broken manifest.

The same boundary applies to `settings`: a board declaring settings gets a Settings sub-page
once it is trusted or installed, but editing the cached manifest directly does not update that
page live. Toggle trust off and on or restart Persephone to refresh it.

## Testing & automation (for an AI agent)

Once the user has opened this board in Persephone, an agent can drive it with
`pages[pageId].editor` to test and debug it:

- `call` at `pages` → find this board (`editor: "board-view"`, with its `selectedBoard`)
  and read its `pageId`.
- `pages[pageId].editor.snapshot()` → read the page's accessibility tree (element refs).
- `pages[pageId].editor.click/type/pressKey/evaluate(...)` → interact, using refs from
  the snapshot. Pass a ref as `{ ref: "e12" }`; a plain string is always a selector.
- `persephone.service.request(message)` → reach the declared service from the board frame; use
  `persephone.storage` for shared JSON state and call `app.boards.list()` from the host renderer
  when you need the service lifecycle payload.
- **Secondary views** (if this board declares any): every `pages[pageId].editor` call targets the
  main frame by default. `pages[pageId].editor.tabs` lists the main view (`index: 0`,
  id `"main"`) plus one frame per secondary view (id `board-secondary:<viewId>`);
  `pages[pageId].editor.switchTab("board-secondary:<viewId>")` points subsequent calls at that
  frame, so `snapshot()` then reads THAT frame's DOM and `click` / `type`
  drive it. Persephone auto-opens the view's sidebar panel and waits for it to render — the call
  always succeeds, even if the panel was closed (no "frame not mounted" error). `switchTab("main")`
  returns to the main view. All frames share `persephone.state.*`, so a change in one is visible
  when you snapshot another.

**Verify visually, not just structurally.** The accessibility snapshot includes elements that
are invisible on screen (zero-height, overridden `display`, below the fold), so a snapshot that
"looks right" does not prove the board renders right. After UI changes, take
`pages[pageId].editor.screenshot()` and inspect the image before declaring the UI correct.
Two classic CSS traps a snapshot won't catch: the `[hidden]` attribute loses to any explicit
`display` rule (add `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` if you style displays), and a
textarea sized by script before layout collapses to zero height (prefer CSS
`field-sizing: content` for auto-growing inputs).

The board must be **open** (the user opens it; an untrusted project won't render).
Navigation does not apply — a board is a fixed document; `tabs` and
`switchTab("board-secondary:<viewId>")` select among its frames (main + secondary views) rather
than creating/closing tabs.

## More examples — the bundled Demo board

Persephone ships a full **Demo board** that exercises the whole surface — the
`persephone.execute()` channel (buffered / streaming / stdin / kill / cwd), the
integration tier, the declared `service.mjs` process (`persephone.service.request`, shared
storage, lifecycle failures, and `boards.list().service`), the `--p-*` theme + token contract, secondary views + shared state
(`persephone.state.*`), and a tabbed multi-view layout with a pinned output console. When you
need a richer reference than this starter,
read the Demo board's files (`index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`, `board-base.css`):

- **Ask the app:** call the `get_app_info` MCP tool — it returns `demoBoardDir` (the exact path to
  the bundled demo board) and `resourcesDir`, so you never have to guess the install location.
- **Installed app:** under the Persephone install's `resources/assets/demo-board/`.
- **From source (dev):** `assets/demo-board/` in the repository.

## Ship your own documentation — the `guides` folder

Put the board's user and agent documentation **in the board**, not in the app: it then versions and
ships with the board and cannot drift out of sync with a Persephone release.

1. Add `"guides": "guides"` to `board-manifest.json`.
2. Create `guides/index.md` (the entry page) and any further `.md` files, nested folders included.
3. Start every page with the front-matter block Persephone's own guides use:

```markdown
---
title: "Using My Board"
audience: user
summary: "One sentence, shown beside the page in the About guide tree."
editorId: "board"
---

# Using My Board
...
```

- `title` and `summary` are required. `audience` is `user`, `agent` or `both`; `agent` pages stay
  hidden until the reader turns on **Show agent guides**, so a user guide and an agent reference can
  live side by side.
- `editorId: "board"` marks the page as the documentation **for this board** — that is what `F1` on
  one of the board's pages opens. Use the literal token `board`; the board's real editor id embeds
  its absolute path and differs on every machine, so it can never be written into a shipped guide.
- A `## Layout` section is read back by `guides[...].layout`, the same as for built-in guides.

Only a **trusted** board contributes documentation, and untrusting or removing the board drops its
pages from the tree and from search immediately.
